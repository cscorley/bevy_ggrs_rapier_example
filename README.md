This is my quest to get GGRS and Rapier to work together in the Bevy engine.

Is it perfect? No. But is well-written? Also no.

Hopefully this will serve as a crash course to getting your fun weekend project
going.

Things I have going

- Deterministic physics and rollbacks
- Desync detection (1v1 only)
- One big file, full of poorly strung together comments
- And a whole lot of debug learning

Keys

- WASD movement
- R turn on random movement for this window
- T turn off random movement for this window
