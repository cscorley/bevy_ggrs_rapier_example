# Overriding glam for https://github.com/cscorley/bevy_ggrs_rapier_example/issues/22
# We have this here so we can explicitly declare the libm feature to ensure it's
# enabled.  These changes are released under glam 0.24, and we can update this
# to that version when bevy also updates to 0.24.  We will still want to have
# this direct dependency, even though we don't use glam ourselves, because we
# want to force on the libm feature.  Unfortunately, we cannot enable the
# feature via bevy yet, which would be optimal.
